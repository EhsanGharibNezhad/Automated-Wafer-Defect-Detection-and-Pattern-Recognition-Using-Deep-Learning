# Automated-Wafer-Defect-Detection-and-Pattern-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning

Developed a deep learning-based framework for automated defect detection and pattern recognition in semiconductor wafer images. Utilized AutoEncoder Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with PyTorch for feature extraction and classification, achieving an accuracy of 98% and a precision of 93% for defect classification. Employed data augmentation techniques and Bayesian Optimization Hyderabad, enhancing model robustness and generalization.
